# Logging into Digital Scholar Lab through the Catalog

[Return to the main Gale Digital Scholar Lab tutorial](https://mdl.library.utoronto.ca/technology/tutorials/digital-humanities-tools-digital-scholar-lab)

This short guide provides instructions on how to log into the [Gale Digital Scholar Lab](https://mdl.library.utoronto.ca/technology/text-data-mining-software/gale-digital-scholar-lab) via the University of Toronto institutional access.

1. To access the DSL,**go to<https://uoft.me/gale>.**You can also access the DSL through our U of T institutional connection by going to the [library catalogue](https://mdl.library.utoronto.ca/). The default is to search Map and Data's website. Click on the Library Search tab. Type “Digital Scholar Lab” in the search box, and click the search button.

    DSL should be the first result, under Other. Click it.  
        <img src='{{ '/assets/images/DSL_Access_001.2.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Digital Scholar lab search result highlighted.' title='' width='800' height='' />
2. Then on DSL page, click Electronic Resource under View Online.

3. The website will first prompt you for your University of Toronto login.  
<img src='{{ '/assets/images/DSL_Access_003.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Connect to this resource with your UTORid page with the UTORid login button highlighted.' title='' width='800' height='' />
4. Enter your UTORid.

5. You will arrive at the DSL homepage, but you will need to log in before you can do anything. Currently, this service can only authenticate Google accounts. DSL doesn't use your Google account for authentication, but solely to track session information, so If you have any reservations about using your personal Gmail account,**feel free to make a new account just for DSL.**Gale’s privacy policy states:

    *When logging in to the Gale Digital Scholar Lab App using either Google or Microsoft, the App accesses the user’s Google Drive or Microsoft OneDrive through an anonymous access token that is created when users first log in. This anonymous token is generated in order to connect users to the content and analysis they create in the Digital Scholar Lab. The App does not collect, read, access, or store any of the data from a user’s Google Drive or Microsoft OneDrive account(s), nor does it access any open documents. In addition, the App does not access or share personal information as part of this process.*

    You can also email[privacy@cengage.com](mailto:privacy@cengage.com)for more details.

    If this is acceptable to you,**click on Log In / Create Account,** 
        <img src='{{ '/assets/images/DSL_Access_005.1.jpg' | relative_url }}' alt='Gale Digital Scholar Lab main page with “Log In / Create Account” highlighted.' title='' width='800' height='' />

 **Choose Google, and then log in with a Google account.** 
        <img src='{{ '/assets/images/DSL_Access_005.2.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Log In / Create Account with the option to sign in with a google account highlighted.' title='' width='800' height='' />

    If you already have an account set up, when you log in a pop\-up window will appear to ask you to choose or create a new workspace. Click on the one created by default, labeled **'Personal'**.  
        <img src='{{ '/assets/images/DSL_Access_005.3.jpg' | relative_url }}' alt='Workspace select window with the “Personal” option highlighted.' title='' width='600' height='' />

    If this is your first time logging in, Gale will prompt you set up your account. First you will be asked to agree to the Terms of Use and their Policy Notice. Once you've checked those boxes, click continue.  
        <img src='{{ '/assets/images/DSL_Access_005.4.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Account set up window step 1, with the Terms boxes highlighted and checked yes. ' title='' width='600' height='' />

    Next you're asked to enter in a display name.  
        <img src='{{ '/assets/images/DSL_Access_005.5.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Account set up window step 2, with the Name field completed.' title='' width='600' height='' />

    Finally, pick an avatar for your account. Click 'Finish set up' once you are done.  
        <img src='{{ '/assets/images/DSL_Access_005.6.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Account set up window step 3, with an avatar selected' title='' width='600' height='' />

    Now that your account is set up, you be asked to choose or create a new workspace, same as if you had just logged in.  
        <img src='{{ '/assets/images/DSL_Access_007.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Workspace selection popup.' title='' width='800' height='' />

    Unless otherwise stated, the rest of these tutorials assumes you're working in a Personal workspace, but if you plan to collaborate with others, or just want to learn about the Digital Scholar Lab's notetaking features, you can learn about[collaboration and notes](https://mdl.library.utoronto.ca/technology/tutorials/digital-scholar-lab-collaboration-and-notes).

    Otherwise, please select **Personal** and proceed to [start building a collection](https://mdl.library.utoronto.ca/technology/tutorials/digital-scholar-lab-collections)
6. You're in! When you return to the Digital Scholar Lab homepage, you should notice your name in the top\-right corner, under Signed in.
